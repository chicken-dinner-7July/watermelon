## Frequently Asked Questions

What's the difference between $20 and $50?

$20 = single-env push-to-deploy (HTML or Flask). $50 = multi-env (Dev auto + manual Staging/Prod), Terraform guardrails, destroy workflow, caching.

Can I upgrade from $20 to $50 later?

Yes. Replace the $20 workflows with the $50 set and follow the Quickstart. Your infra state can stay; you mainly swap CI steps.

Can I customize it?

Absolutely. You're licensed to modify for your own projects: edit variables, add steps, swap AMIs, or extend the pipeline.
